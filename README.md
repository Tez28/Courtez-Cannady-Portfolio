## My Portfolio

My portfolio showcases my current capbalilities in web-development. Users visiting my portfolio page will see a header with functioning navigation links that to sections detailing information about them. The sections include infromation about me, my projects and a way to contact me. Users will see that not only do the navigation links work but the run-buddy project in the work section opens a seperate browser to the run-buddy webpage that I built working through the course. Users will also see, once scrolling down, that the contact links are all functional. Users will have the capability of clicking the email link and it will open up an email to contact me, click the GitHub link to be directed to my page or the LinkedIn link to be directed to my profile. Users will see that my portfolio page can be viewed on various screen sizes. The site is responsive and can adjust to the resizing of screens.
